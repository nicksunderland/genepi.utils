\arguments{
\item{snps}{character vector, rsids}

\item{stat}{character, the R stat to calculate, one of "r2-unphased", "r2-phased", "r-unphased", "r-phased"}

\item{win_kb}{numeric, the window to look in around the variants}

\item{win_r2}{numeric, the lower r2 limit to include in output, (for --r-phased and --r-unphased, this means |r|â‰¥sqrt(0.2))}

\item{win_ninter}{numeric, controls the maximum number of other variants allowed between variant-pairs in the report. Inf = off.}

\item{plink2}{character / path, the plink2 executable}

\item{pfile}{character / path, the plink pfile set}
